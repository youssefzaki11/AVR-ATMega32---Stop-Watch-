The function of the Project is: Developing a system that controls the Stop Watch Timer and displays it on six of 7-segments by using GPIO, Timer1, External Interrupts, and 7-Segment.
I set Interrupt 0 for Reset the Stop Watch, Interrupt 1 for Pausing the Stop Watch and Interrupt 2 for Resume the Stop Watch.
I used Timer1 to control the time, as the time increments by 1 second
